##Reddit's Random Walk

This is a replication repository that will eventually be a reference for a forthcoming paper exploring the degree to which the variance of cumulative posting behavior on Reddit can be estimated accurately by a simple random walk model. The draft paper along with code to replicate the results are located in the paper and code folders, respectively.

###Installation & Requirements

You need a few tools and a minimum system setup in order to analyze the dataset directly for replication purposes. In terms of installation, the machine you run this on assumes (though this may work on other setups) an Ubuntu 16.04 box, MongoDB 3.2.9, Redis 3.0.6, Ruby 2.3.0 [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
